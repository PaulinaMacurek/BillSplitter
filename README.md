# BillSplitter
Project made as part of the Python Core course at Jet Brains Academy

## About
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

## Learning outcomes
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.
